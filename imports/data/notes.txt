rounded coords throw off fsmodel?
coord pushed to array in fsmodel passed by reference? 
performance boost from fsmodel methods being external functions?
if there are no spaces in a post then the text doesnt wrap
  even very long words in the wrong place can make a textbox bigger than anticipated[?]
optimizations
  remove variable declaration from radiusBetween, other frequently used functions
  do i even need the postob object or can i use whatever the query returns?
  pass measurement functions more specific variables where possible [instead of objects]

optimizations in filled space model
  if a short text box spawns next to a tall one it trims the overhanging platform a little
  fsm doesnt always center 
  fsm doesnt seek closest spot by radius





box sliding right along top skyline
  first platform gives initial y
    if it can drop down before hitting obstruction, it gets new y
    first obstruction gives x, and we have new possibleCenter
    if it reaches alignedx, we have x and new possibleCenter
    after reaching obstruction, we have new y


todo
  make meteor method part that updates last discussed recursive
  add block to fsm outline updater that takes care of the unlikely case of a post box being fit perfectly into a hole within the outer outline [remove all sides of marginBox]
