rounded coords throw off fsmodel?
coord pushed to array in fsmodel passed by reference? 
performance boost from fsmodel methods being external functions?
if there are no spaces in a post then the text doesnt wrap
  even very long words in the wrong place can make a textbox bigger than anticipated
i think if a short text box spawns next to a tall one it trims the overhanging platform a little
optimization
  move fsmodel out of debateTreeChanged
  populating postob properties from one query instead of multiple
  do i even need the postob object or can i use whatever the query returns?
  pass measurement functions more specific variables where possible [instead of objects]

optimizations in filled space model
  right now filled space model only checks one adjacent platform to fit a new text box
  fsm doesnt always center 
  fsm doesnt seek closest spot by radius
