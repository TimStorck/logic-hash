get angle to center of previousBox from center of motionBox
  if upperRight, get rightEdge of previousBox
    get angle to rightEdge of previousBox from rightEdge of motionBox
      if 


either trying to bring textBox down, or trying to bring it left, or trying to bring it up, or trying to bring it right

update upperEdge as you go and test against it for textboxes you want to bring down

check upper edge for lowest point
  see if it will fit there
    check for other spot at that point
      see if it will fit there
        check next lowest point
          if it fits, check other spots at that point
            record spot with shortest radius from motion

  updateTopLine (div, referredFromAdjacent)
    get new points
      if (!referredFromAdjacent)
        if extend beyond left edge
          update left line
        if extend beyond right edge
          update right line
      any points in between new points horizontally, splice out
      push new points
