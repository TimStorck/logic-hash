rounded coords throw off fsmodel?
performance boost from fsmodel methods being external functions?
if there are no spaces in a post then the text doesnt wrap
  even very long words in the wrong place can make a textbox bigger than anticipated[?]
optimizations
  remove variable declaration from radiusBetween, other frequently used functions
  do i even need the postob object or can i use whatever the query returns?
  pass measurement functions more specific variables where possible [instead of objects]

optimizations in filled space model
  if a short text box spawns next to a tall one it trims the overhanging platform a little
  fsm doesnt always center 
  fsm doesnt seek closest spot by radius



todo
  make meteor method part that updates last discussed recursive
  add block to fsm outline updater that takes care of the unlikely case of a post box being fit perfectly into a hole within the outer outline [remove all sides of marginBox]
  see if this part is needed in fsm:
    //if lineArray line connected to consolidated lineArray line doesn't cross marginBox line opposite the consolidated marginbox line
  make flag box modal position adapt to screen boundaries adjusted for draggable debate  
  make respond button not highlightable
  see if you can get the respond button floating at the bottom right within the text by nesting it in a div
  mouseover postbox highlights elicitor textbox ?
  clean out measurements file
